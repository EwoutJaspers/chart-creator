# Timetrend chart-creator
R Shiny app to help create [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) interactive charts for the new ISD website

## Data file preparation
To use the settings creator the following columns need to be included in the csv data file: 

*	date variable column (required). 

*	NHS Board location column (dropdown - required). At the moment the first column needs to be an NHS Board column, this will change in the next update to the chart creator. 

*	Second location column (e.g. hospitals) (dropdown - optional)

*	Measure column (e.g. specialty) (dropdown - optional)  

*	Variable columns (maximum 6 can be included in a chart, though it advised to not include more than 3 to 4 lines).
